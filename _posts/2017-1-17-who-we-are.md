description: Our team is led by technology veterans with expertise in applying results-driven software development and change management methodologies.
We’re boots on the ground change agents

We have a successful record of partnering with leaders and their teams to build a unified, high-performing technology organization underpinned by a culture of trust, teamwork and shared responsibility. While coaching you and your team to evolve the culture, we also are in the trenches with them to develop and deploy.

We specialize in serving large, complex enterprises

We have partnered with large, siloed organizations that have enormous development teams regularly more than 500 engineers. We know how to implement solutions in complex environments that contain more than an application server, http server and database. It is routine for us to work within ecosystems that have a patchwork of hundreds of independent components and dozens of technologies.

Our methodology

We bring you our deep experience to evolve your:

Culture: Your organization’s culture is the primary prerequisite for building a high-performing technology team underlined by greater cooperation between the development and deployment teams.

Tools: We share proven tools that enable work to be performed in a structured, repeatable and consistent manner, removing ambiguity and enforcing a delivery pipeline through which work can be automated and measured.

Process: We embed processes to enable the framework in which work can be done in repeatable and consistent ways with software delivery and quality as the primary drivers.
